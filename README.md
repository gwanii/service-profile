# service-profile is now deprecated

The `service-profile` repo is deprecated. See these resources on how to create a
CORD profile using the new build method:

https://github.com/opencord/platform-install/blob/master/README.md

There's also a document to help with migration from the previous
service-profile method to the new platform-install/profile_manifest method:

If you have questions about this, please post to cord-dev@opencord.org list, or
ask on the CORD Slack.
